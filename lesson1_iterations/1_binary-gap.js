/**
 * A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros
 * that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.
 *
 * For example:
 * - number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2.
 * - number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.
 * - number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.
 * - number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
 * - number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * function solution(N);
 *
 * that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap.
 * The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
 *
 * For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation
 * 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should
 * return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

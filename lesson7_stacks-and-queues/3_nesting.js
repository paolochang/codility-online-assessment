/**
 * A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:
 *
 * S is empty;
 * S has the form "(U)" where U is a properly nested string;
 * S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
 * For example, string "(()(())())" is properly nested but string "())" isn't.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * function solution(S);
 *
 * that, given a string S consisting of N characters,
 * returns 1 if string S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * For example, given S = "(()(())())", the function should return 1
 * and given S = "())", the function should return 0, as explained above.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000];
 * string S consists only of the characters "(" and/or ")".

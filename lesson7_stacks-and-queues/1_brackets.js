/**
 * A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested
 * if any of the following conditions is true:
 *
 * S is empty;
 * S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
 * S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
 *
 * For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * function solution(S);
 *
 * that, given a string S consisting of N characters,
 * returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given
 * S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
 * string S consists only of the following characters: "(", "{", "[", "]", "}" and/or ")".

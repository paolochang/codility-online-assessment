/**
 * An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers
 * in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.
 *
 * Your goal is to find that missing element.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * function solution(A);
 *
 * that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
 *
 * For example, given array A such that:
 *
 *   A[0] = 2
 *   A[1] = 3
 *   A[2] = 1
 *   A[3] = 5
 *
 * the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
 * the elements of A are all distinct;
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].

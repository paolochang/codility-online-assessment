#### 2. Arrays:

- CyclicRotation[Easy]: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.
- OddOccurrencesInArray[Easy]: Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.

#### 3. Time Complexity

- FrogJmp[Easy]: Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

- TapeEquilibrium[Easy]: Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.

#### 4. Counting Elements

- FrogRiverOne[Easy]: Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.
- PermCheck[Easy]: Check whether array A is a permutation.

- Fish[Easy]: N voracious fish are moving along a river. Calculate how many fish are alive.
- Nesting[Easy]: Determine whether a given string of parentheses (single type) is properly nested.
- StoneWall[Easy]: Cover "Manhattan skyline" using the minimum number of rectangles.

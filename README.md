### Lessons

1. Iterations:
   - BinaryGap[Easy]: Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.
2. Arrays:
   - CyclicRotation[Easy]: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.
   - OddOccurrencesInArray[Easy]: Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.
3. Time Complexity
   - FrogJmp[Easy]: Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.
   - PermMissingElem[Easy]: Find the missing element in a given permutation.
   - TapeEquilibrium[Easy]: Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.
4. Counting Elements
   - FrogRiverOne[Easy]: Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.
   - PermCheck[Easy]: Check whether array A is a permutation.
   - MaxCounters[Medium]: Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.
   - MissingInteger[Medium]: Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence.
5. Prefix Sums
   - PassingCars[Easy]: Count the number of passing cars on the road.
   - CountDiv[Medium]: Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b].
